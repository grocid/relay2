Relay is an IRC client that attemps to be small, quick, easy to use, elegant, and functional. 
The Github and Launchpad repos are mirrored. You can find up-to-date information about Relay on Launchpad and Github.

If Relay displays with a light interface please open up an issue and let me know what displays when you type
`echo $XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP`. I will need to add some code to detect and load a suitable dark theme preloaded
in your distro.

New changes are being made all the time! Make sure to update often with `git pull`! Then just follow the installation steps.
